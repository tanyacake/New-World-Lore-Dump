# Tales of Everfall

# Treasure of Arcturus

## Death Log

Found in Arcturus

Death 7: Cornered on the staircase leading to the second floor.
Death 8: Barely got in the door this time before I was swarmed from all angles by Ancients.
Death 9: Reached the top floor! The Arcturian Piercer and allies proved too strong; I died but meters away from the treasure.

The treasure is so close I can taste it! How cruel, how unfair of these  lingering skeletons to guard something they can no longer use.
I am making attempt number 10 tonight and I am sure I will be victorious.

## Piercing Eyes

Found in Arcturus

The Piercer's gaze is calculated and cold. Sockets  where eyes should be cut through my body, striking fear into my heart.  Standing here I can avoid their line of sight, shaking in my boots as I  prepare to take on the well-armored Guardian.
I ready my axe with unsteady hands and pause for a prayer.

May Providence guard my soul.

# Trappings of Death

## Gourds For Sale

Found in Olcott Family Farm

We've instructed the little ones in the ways of the  Trading Post, and they seem to be taking to it swimmingly. They, with  the protection of the older ones, take our goods to market while we sow  the fields. All of Everfall now knows of the Olcott Family gourds and  their quality. Our life here is so much more prosperous than we could  have ever imagined when we took the risk to leave the Old World behind.  Yes, there is danger abound here but if one simply sticks to the roads  and a steady routine, even a family as big and peaceful as ours can  survive and even flourish.

Sawyer Olcott

## A Red Glow in the Woods

Found in Olcott Family Farm

I can hardly sleep tonight after father pointed it  out. A red glow in the woods, ever so faint among the tops of the trees. I thought it mad at first, for who would climb the trees but a hunter  setting up a blind? It dawned on me that this red entity could indeed be a hunter, and that we are the ones being hunted. I feel crimson eyes on me now. I won't take the little ones to market tomorrow, I won't even  leave this house. Something or someone is coming, and we must be  prepared.

Jamison Olcott

# Syndicate's Strength

## Creeping Red Tide

Found in Bradbury Fields

I have spotted them from the distance, a creeping red tide of Corruption miasma. They encroach upon the nearby Bradbury  Fields after the Bradbury family abandoned their homestead, filling the  vacuum of power left by their departure. This does not bode well for the Everfall settlement to have Corruption so far South, so close to our  homes and workstations. I will keep my agents close to the farm and  observe how the Corrupted move, making sure they at least do not cross  the Fields into civilization.

Alchemist Olivera

# Reese's Watch

## Storms Aplenty

Found in Everfall Watch Tower

There have been even more of those violent storms as  of late. I hear the crash of thunder and see the bolts of red lightning  in the distance from my place at the watch tower. I am haunted that I  cannot do a thing but wait to see if survivors wash up on my shore. Half of those who do wash up here are often too broken to be of any use,  well on their way to becoming a Drowned or Withered. Am I truly so  powerless as to not be able to do anything for them?

-Reese

## Supply Manifest

Found in Everfall Boar Infestation

Food Supplies:
-3 crates of berries
-10 bushels of corn
-5 gourds (medium)
-3 sacks of grains

This should be enough to get you through to the next shipment, Reese.

Use it wisely.

-Tucket

## Pushing My Luck

Found in Beringer's Boon

I have pushed my luck too far. I dare go no farther than this shipwreck. 

I have tried in the past to make it to Huang's Hammer or at least the  Harpy of Henninger, but each time I am swarmed by Drowned and... um,  "die." 
It seems like my soul comes back a little weaker than the  last time. I cannot afford to lose faith, or even more will fall here. 
I must remain cautious, remain vigilant, and await help.

-Reese

# Polly's Follies

## Madwoman

Found in Stonetooth Terrace

Elizabeth Polly is a complete and total madwoman. She provides me with no weapon, no protection against the Undead tides she  sends me through to get to the Fen. And then she damn near bites my head off when I return haggard and empty-handed, as if her tavern supplies  are worth dying for! These pirates are a menace, but so is she. I quit.

## Tavern Supplies

Found in Stonetooth Terrace

Fifteen tankards, exactly as requested. I gave the  porter a wooden mace and a new coat to defend himself on his way back to you. The poor lad barely survived the trip here, and his clothes were  in tatters from how the Undead harassed him so. You really ought to put  more stock into protecting your porters, Elizabeth, lest you want your  supplies stolen again. Now that the pirates have had a taste of my fine  craftsmanship in drink-ware. I fear they've acquired an appetite for it, and know to attack the porter on sight.

# Pirate's Plunder

## Captain's Log 24

Found in Riverworn Grotto

We are thirty days at sea, tossed by gale winds and  rumbling waves. The crew are tossed from their bunks when trying to  sleep, and some have taken to tying themselves down for their resting  shifts.

The closer we come to that strange land mass the more  violent the ocean becomes, so we have tried our best to sail around it.  The navigator is perplexed. There is no known island here on any maps.

Captain Yennifer

## Captain's Log 31

Found in Riverworn Grotto

Pirates. Bloody pirates. We were boarded while I was  abed last night and several of my men were slaughtered in the taking of  the ship. Their bodies were tossed unceremoniously overboard and even  more than that some living who defied the invaders were also thrown to  the sea. I am cooperating for now, keeping my captain's log in a secret  place.

I can only hope some pages survive, as it seems the  pirates are intent to make landfall on the island we were trying our  best to avoid. I believe it to be a suicide mission but their captain,  Master Henry as he's called, is sure this island holds riches  unimaginable. For the sake of my crew I hope these pirates get what they want, and then promptly let us go. Even life on a deserted island is  better than being a prisoner at sea.

Captain Yennifer

# Life on the Fallowhill

## Prosperity

Found in Fallowhill Farm

Today is a dark day at Fallowhill Farm. Farmer  Paulson has succumb to Withering, leaving the once-proud man naught but a chittering, gibbering mess. We mourn him, but we must also now be wary  of him and others who, in their repeated deaths to the Corrupted and  elements, may follow him. Could this signal the end of our prosperity? I pray to Providence that no more of us turn, and that this farm stays  productive for the Everfall and Monarch's Bluffs settlements that rely  upon our crops.

# Lewis' Fears

## Beware the Bear

Found in Everfall Settlement

Polly said it might help me if I wrote some of my fears down. It'd take away their power, she said, so here goes.

Bears. Massive teeth, massive claws, and a roar to wake the dead. I am  terrified of bears and know that they roam Bearclaw Pass to the east of  here, hence its nomenclature. I have heard fearsome Lynxes roam the area as well... Oh, bother, I don't think this is helping.

## Ghosts Abound

Found in Everfall Settlement

Another fear I have is ghosts. Polly looks at me  strangely when I speak of this fear, but how could she not be afraid of  spirits come back from the dead?! Their spectral hands reach for me in  my nightmares to slash at my throat, grip cold and hollow. I know  they're out there, and I think writing about them is only making me more scared...

# Heron's Field Notes

## Guardians' Attacks

Found in Lupus

Formidable in battle, the Guardians of the Ancient  ruins of Aeternum are not to be trifled with. I have lost many a life to them in my research. Still, I have begun to notice some patterns in  their fighting, allowing me to escape when the time is right. The  Ancient Guardians wielding clubs rear back before they try to smash your skull in, a rather painful way to die, and I am able to predict their  movements with some veracity in watching how they charge at me. My head  is still ringing from my last death, the ghost of the crack in my skull  throbbing idly as a reminder of my still having a long way to go in  combat skills.

## Half-Formed

Found in Norma

Some of the bodies of the Ancient Guardians are only  half-preserved, cursing them to an eternity of crawling on their bellies to reach their next destination. I made the mistake of underestimating  these crawling torsos and was met with a swift death from the way they  have adapted to jump up at and claw down their enemies. I refuse to give up on my research simply because of the forceful resistance I am being  met with, but those crawlers haunt my nightmares in ways their standing  brethren do not. I feel a chill down my spine writing about them even  now.

## Guardians' Weapons

Found in Hercules

The weapons the Ancient Guardians carry are of a  rudimentary level of craftsmanship. Occasionally they can be found with  steel armaments but most often it is a low-grade iron with which they  fashion their weapons. They seem to lack the capacity for ranged weapons beyond a few commanders carrying javelins for throwing, and are a  people who live and die by the sword and mace. Their bony hands can also deal a great amount of damage when raked across skin, so even unarmed  Guardians should be considered dangerous.

## Guardians' Resolve

Found in Ursa

The Guardians attack all humans who dare trespass on  the ruins of the Ancients. While animals are free to come and go,  anything that stands on two legs is met with immediate and brutal  hostility. Without eyes how do they see what they are attacking? Some of their attacks are sloppy and seemingly blind, so perhaps they rely on  the other senses in combat. How they stand and fight without muscles in  the first place is still a mystery.

## Reaching Towards the Heavens

Found in Lacerta

These lookout towers reach up towards the heavens,  perplexing the common observer as to how they were erected in the first  place. Was scaffolding used? If so there are no remnants of it, and no  external support beams to keep the towers up. To me they seem to have  grown directly from the ground like proud stone evergreens, stacked high enough to touch the clouds.

## The Orbs

Found in Carina

Even more fascinating than the lookout towers  themselves are the massive orbs near the top of them. They look so large it vexes the mind to imagine how the Ancients got them up there. Is  their directional positioning significant in any way? The orbs appear to bulge out of only one of the sides of the tower, and look similar to  the orbs found around Windsward.

## Syndicate Expulsion

Found in Draco

I parted with the Syndicate today.

More aptly, they parted with me, those arrogant fools, but I was close to leaving  them anyway. Their jealousy was bearing down on my back over this  Ancient research and I believe they were either plotting to steal it  from me or take me out of the picture. Alchemist Olivera seemed  regretful to expel me but I surmise this was nothing more than an act.  He has always been envious of how I take fate into my own hands and  pursue the mysteries of azoth on my own without sharing my research. Why should I share? The Syndicate has never done anything for me beyond  send me to my death chasing tokens of their favor.

## Proving Them Wrong

Found in Orion

I can feel the glares from Adjudicator Amano and  Commander Chauhan whenever I pass them in the settlement. They are not  subtle people. I know they disprove of my research into the Ancients,  thinking them heretics or weaklings, but I will prove them wrong. I will prove them all wrong.

## Center of the Stars

Found in Shattered Obelisk

We all know that the earth is the center of the  planets and universe, and it is only fitting that the jewel of our  planetary system is the one with such a fantastical island like Aeternum on it. If our planet is the center of the heavens then Aeternum must be the center of the planet, located so closely to the equator and imbued  with power as it is. Azoth, the substance found here and nowhere else,  is further proof that is the primordial Eden of which the scriptures  spoke, the place from which all life sprang. I am honored and humbled to be standing at the center of everything, and must know what the  Ancients thought of this phenomenon.

## Bodily Limitations

Found in Shattered Obelisk

I can feel the toll of the last few deaths especially heavily. My stomach still aches where it was stabbed by the rusty sword of an Ancient Guardian and no amount of healing drops seem to soothe  the pain. I am becoming weaker with each resurrection, waning like the  moon until there is nothing left. I must put a pause on my research for  now, and find someone who can venture out in my name and the name of the astronomical sciences. I shall wait in the settlement for someone of a  like mind who can continue my fieldwork.

# Fishery Foibles

## Nothing's Biting Today

Found in Meadow Lake Fishery

All that racket Morrison was making last night must  have scared off the fish. That damn fool, running around and singing at  the top of his lungs like this were some Old World stage. Now I sit with my line in the water completely still, not a bite in sight. Lord knows  why I put up with him.

## Withered Spotted

Found in Meadow Lake Fishery

The bloated corpse of an adventurer washed up in the  nets today, and the poor lass was neither dead nor alive. She was  Withered, missing an arm and her wits. Morrison had to use his fishing  spear to pierce her skull and put her out of her misery. It is odd, for  Withered usually do not come this way. My instincts tell me this will  not be the last Withered we will see, and that as more lost souls wash  up on this island, more will be made into fetid and mindless husks.

# Fall of Kelleher

## Suspicions

Found in Kelleher Farmstead

Something is different about Jennifer. She has never  been eager to peddle our pumpkins at the settlement before, calling the  trek there twice as boring as it is dangerous. Now she practically jumps at the opportunity to sell our wares. Her father suspects nothing, but a mother knows. Something has happened with our little girl, now a grown  woman in her rights, that drives her away from the farm. The next time  we go to the trading post I will be keeping a close eye on her  activities and conversations... She looks like how I first felt when I  met Michael in the Old World.

Sarah Kelleher

## He's Different With Me

Found in Kelleher Farmstead

That gruff, tired-looking man who guards the  Watchtower is different with me. He has seen so much death, so many  adventurers wash upon his shores only to lose their minds and lives  fighting off Drowned. Battleworn as he is, Reese always has a smile for  me. I find myself longing to see that smile, longing to remove his  helmet and see his face in its full, scarred glory. I dream of a day  when I can walk the settlement together with him, arm-in-arm, so that  everyone might see, even mother and father. For now, though, we exchange coded notes so that none can read what we wish to say to one another.

Jennifer Kelleher

# Daybreak to Decrepit

## Dawn in Daybreak

Found in Daybreak Borough

The herb fields are flourishing. We have carved a  little slice of paradise out for ourselves here in Daybreak Borough. We  have relative peace. Though, truth be told, the pirates to the south do  accost us on occasion if we venture too close to their territory.

Recent news of the infestation and fall of the Kelleher Farmstead to the north is heartbreaking. But we are strong here. We have armed defenders  willing to fall again and again to defend what we have built and now  call home.

## Daybreak Falls

Found in Daybreak Borough

The defenders have fallen. After so many deaths we have lost our once-proud town guards to chittering madness or desertion. 

The Withered horde from the Kelleher Farmstead was too strong; first in a  manageable trickle of shambling flesh, but now, flowing like a heavy  stream of rot and decay. This place has become overrun and little  remains of the herb fields. We have no choice but to join the walled  settlement to the west. Our hopes of a free and prosperous borough  outside of such confines have been utterly dashed.

# Covenant's Quest

## Ancients and Their Guardians

Found in Arcturus

Regarding the Ancient Guardians of Aeternum, it is  clear that these beings worship Ancient society but are not Ancients  themselves. The statues around ruins like Arcturus and others of its  magnitude indicate the Ancients had four arms and a split face, of which these skeletons that guard the ruins have neither. We can only be left  to conclude that the skeletons that shamble about Ancient ruins are  those of heretics and traitors to their own humanity in revering beings  like the Ancietnts.

Adjudicator Amano

# Corrupted Mining Operations

## Ichorous Spread

Found in Ebenrock Cavern

The ichorous, slow spread of red down from Brightwood and Great Cleave has not been given proper attention by the Everfall  settlement authorities. Lewis is too scared to look, Clark is too busy  with bloody paperwork, Lee is off doing... whatever Lee does. Patricia  is the only one who listens.

A.Y.

## Corrupted Observations

Found in Ebenrock Cavern

The way these Corrupted work is of a singular mind,  all their pickaxe blows to the rocks timed perfectly with one another.  They take almost no breaks, one cook serving the entire operation that I can see from this vantage point.

A.Y.

# Canary in the Mines

## Patricia and Alexandra

Found in Canary Mine

Tomorrow Alexandra and I will make an investigation  of the Canary Mine to the north. We've packed steel weapons and tools  for our expedition, as well as several helpings of cooked meat given to  us by Lee. Nice man. Alexandra insists we bring him something shiny back to thank him, for he would like that sort of thing. Alexandra is always thinking of others.

-P.P.

## Obituary for Alexandra

Found in Canary Mine

Here lies a friend to many, a crafter of renown, and a partner whom I shall never replace. Felled by the Corrupted Dredgers,  Alexandra Yanille put up a brave and noble fight before her untimely  demise. My hatred for the Corrupted burns brighter than ever, and I will get to the bottom of this mystery regarding their presence, for  Alexandra. I will find out why the Corrupted are so far South, and I  will put a stop to them.

-Patricia Petrowski
