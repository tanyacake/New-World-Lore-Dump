# Tales of Restless Shore

# Rabbit Reads

## The Family

Found on Rabbit Island

Today we have a new addition to our family, a pair of spotted rabbits I rescued from Windsward where adventurers were killing them nonstop. I will call them Romeo and Juliet after the recent play  of fame in the Old World.

## Stanley

Found on Rabbit Island

I don't pick favorites, but if I was to pick a  favorite, it would have to be Stanley. He is the crown jewel of my  rabbit collection, stolen from up north where the Corrupted hunted him  for meat. He is a beautiful snowshoe hare with the softest fur I have  ever had the pleasure of feeling. I hold him close to me at night when I am coughing and cannot sleep, and he seems to understand my plight. He  stays at my side, and I could not ask for a more loyal companion.

# Pirate's Life

## The Great Port Heist

Found in Neptune's Fury

Matis and Chekov and I will distract the Captain.  You, Anne, and Henry sneak into his quarters and use Anne's lockpicking  skills to get into the red cabinet on the left of the room. Grab the  Port, pour it into a flask and replace everything you took with  seawater. This won't deter him long but it'll give us a few precious  moments between him pouring the Port and realizing that some of it has  been replaced. Return with the flask and Henry will give the all-clear  signal and boom, we're swimming in quality drink. There's no way this  plan could go wrong.

## Captain's Orders

Found in Neptune's Fury

Stay out of the Captain's Quarters if you value your  sorry lives. I know at least one of you scoundrels has been helping  themselves to my bottles of Port I keep locked up within, and I will  find out who it is. When I do, they're getting the plank! Your days are  numbered, thief, for only a fool robs a robber.

## Rules

Found in West Lookout Camp

Bets are placed on numbers two to twelve, those two  being the rarest scores. Two six-sided dice are rolled, and their sum is the winning number. Whoever gets closest to the winning number gets the pot, and no two players can bet on the same number. If there is a tie,  the pot is split in half favoring the higher number if the pot is  uneven.

## Loaded Dice

Found in East Lookout Camp

Jackson's got loaded dice, I can tell. There's no way in hell the winning number is always seven. He's not even subtle about  it! Those wooden monstrosities need to be tested before our crew loses  the whole haul to him. Gonna talk to the Captain Flotsam about it  tomorrow morning, and anyone who agrees can come with me.

## Captive Proves His Worth

Found in Fort Damnation

The man we took hostage is proving to be more  profitable in our brig than it ever would be to ransom him. His  knowledge of magic and runestones is plentiful. If we, with enough  supervision, give him the materials to attune new runestones to  something valuable, say a kind of drink, then the runestones can guide  us towards it. We've seen how it works for gold and silver, just look at our stores! This wizard has more than proved his worth to us, and the  only thing we have to worry about is him escaping.

## Endless Drink

Found in Fort Damnation

Yo-ho, Yo-ho

Runestones, runestones!

They pulse and quake

They shudder and shake

Leading us to liquid gold!

Yo-ho, yo-ho, now everybody yo-ho!

# Life Outside the Settlement

## Sunrise on Aeternum

Found in Eastshore Pier

Is there a more beautiful view than the sunrise on  Aeternum? Spent beside my family there is no place I would rather be  than sitting on the docks with our feet dangling off over the water. I  close my eyes, feel the warmth of the sun upon me, and I pray we stay  forever this fortunate.

## Sunset Shoals

Found in Eastshore Pier

Last night at sunset Bobby says he saw one of those  grenadiers wandering the coast and killed it. I highly doubt his story.  No undead pirates dare come so close to the settlement and Bobby is  known to be a boastful man. He once 'wrestled' an alligator in an  attempt to impress me and was promptly chomped in half by the gator. So  no, I do not believe we are in any danger of being encroached upon. Tell that to your mother, and set her heart at ease for me.

## Coexisting

Found in Decayed Campsite

Those settlement people with their houses and  workstations think they've conquered the land, but I am not here to  conquer. I am here to coexist, to live off the bounty of Aeternum  without creating structures more permanent than a watchtower. I see  their chimney smoke on cold nights and shiver next to my campfire, but I would never trade my morals for a little warmth. How weak-willed my  husband was to move in to the settlement overnight without as much as  saying goodbye. I will never end up like him.

## Aeternum Provides

Found in Decayed Campsite

The lake nearby gives us fresh water and fish, and  the wolf population of the island gives us furs and meats. We are truly  blessed to be here on Aeternum where nothing truly dies, assuring a  steady supply of food without having to wait for repopulation or worry  about overhunting. The settlement is a luxury we do not need. Aeternum  provides all on its own.

# Fangsnap's Reign

## Day One

Found in Fangsnap's Cave

Today I begin my hunt for Fangsnap. I am loaded with  steel arrows and my trusty sword. This beast has terrorized the coast  for far too long, and it is up to me as Survivalist of the settlement to put the matter to rest.

## Day Four

Found in Fangsnap's Cave

My body and spirit feel broken. My arm tingles where  Fangsnap last closed his fangs around it, tearing flesh from bone that  has now healed, but still the ghost of the injury lingers. I make my  retreat today back to the settlement to regroup and possibly ask for  assistance. But who would be fool enough to go into this cave after all  the horrors that have occurred here at the claws and teeth of such a  rabid beast? Perhaps an adventurer from the new shipwrecks down south  might come along. I can only hope they do.

# Eternal Resting Place

## Eulogy

Found in Solitude Cemetery

Here lies a soul taken from us far too soon. A young  soul, a brave soul, one who spent their life on Aeternum fighting for  the good of others. They deserve more than this shallow grave in a  dilapidated cemetery, but this is the best I can do. Rest well, dearest. I will visit you again soon.

## Warning

Found in Solitude Cemetery

WARNING: Do not proceed! There is a dangerous  individual inside of this pavilion who has lost all sense of conscience  and morality. She is no longer the woman she once was, and must be  avoided at all costs!

# Eternal Conflict

## Bubblebeard's Prayers

Found in Minnow's Revenge

I swear, if I hear one more prayer out of Captain  Bubblebeard, I am going to lose my mind. He prays before battle, he  prays after battle, hell, he prays during battle! We're the ones  carrying this crew to victory every time we have to raid a ship or a  supply line! The man's more cowardly than even some of the green young  lads we take on, and that's saying something with how Katsuki acts  whenever we fire a cannon.

## A Prayer for Peace

Found in Minnow's Revenge

May Providence bless the ship

May Providence bless the crew

Bless the bow, the stern, the aft

Bless me and bless you

Bless each all cannon fodder, bless all the swords and shields

For we will need every blessing when we are in the field.

# Boar Takeover

## Campsite Set-up

Found in Boarsholm

The funniest thing happened to me when I was setting  up my tent. I could have sworn, out of the corner of my eye, I saw  something of about knee-height rustling in the bushes. Figuring it to be a boar, I aimed my musket and fired into the brush, but whatever was  there was gone when I went to find my kill. That was strange, but just  an hour later, when I had finally set up the campfire, did I feel eyes  on me again from the same bush. Was this boar watching me? Or am I going insane?

## Too Many Of Them

Found in Boarsholm

They came at nighttime, and there were too many of  them to fight off. They swarmed McFarland first, all grunts and oinks as they ripped him to shreds. He was resurrected just a few feet to the  left in his campsite and when he reappeared those crazed boars killed  him again! It took him three more deaths and took me two more just to  get out of the campsite boundary. Tomlinson says we should try and  reclaim the camp on sunrise, but I say we abandon this venture. I've  never seen the yellow eyes of a boar look at me with such malice, such  hatred. Something is not right here, and I am not sticking around to  find out why.
